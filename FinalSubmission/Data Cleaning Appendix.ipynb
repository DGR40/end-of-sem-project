    "The following are the questions that we wish to find the answers to with the help of our project and analyses: \n",
    "1) Is there a relationship between the levels of carcinogens in drinking water and leukemia incidence rates?\n",
    "2) Is there a relationship between childhood blood-lead levels and leukemia incidence rate?\n",
    "3) Do incidence rate trends correlate to carcinogen levels?\n",
    "\n",
    "Through our research combing of the web, our team decided to use data from multiple sources including The Pennsylvania Department of Health — which yielded our arsenic and HAA5 data, The National Cancer Institute — which yielded our data regarding incidence rates of leukemia, and finally The Center for Disease Control — which yielded data regarding blood lead levels in the Pennsylvania. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the variety in sourcing of our data, alongside the variability within the different data collected among all of these studies, we conducted extensive data cleaning/ pre-processing, and labeling in order to obtain analysis-ready data. "

    "1. First, we combined data on blood lead levels with data on leukemia incidence rates by county. In order to accomplish this task, we had to delete various extraneous columsn which were prroduced when we obtained the datasets form the CDC and NCI. An example of such a column is 'County Fips' in the blood-lead level data, which was not necessary for our analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. We also had to adjust the formatting of the blood-lead data. It was initially formatted to have an overarching header column over blood levels, titled 'Number of Children with Confirmed BLLs by BLL Group'. We removed this column and renamed every column under it to correctly describe what the column described.\n",
    "  \n",
    "3. Next, we merged the data. This was carried out by first converting each dataframe's respective 'County' column to the same format. We ran into some issues because of inconsistencies within the naming of counties. The counties within the cancer dataframe had a trailing space, so when we tried to merge, pandas could not find any counties that were in both the blood and cancer dataframes. By altering the county names of each county within the  blood dataframe, we got matching county names. We then identified which counties were in both dataframes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Additionally, we converted all percentages, which were strings, into numbers. This allows for easier data analysis\n",
    "  \n",
    "5. We then identified which counties were in both dataframes.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Finally, we merged the two dataframes by county name with the merge function. We then parameterized the process of cleaning the data and made it into a method so we could reuse it with data sets from different years. For this phase, we dropped all counties which had n/a for either percentage of children with confirmed blood lead levels above 5 or 10 micrograms\n",
    "  \n",
    "7. Next, we combined this newly created dataframe with th data regarding arsenic and HAA5 levels in each county. This process was much easier. The main action we had to take was to average the data for each county. For example, a single county could have 10 water treatment plants. We averaged this data and weighted it by population served t ensure an accurate analysis. \n",
    "  \n",
    "8. After this, we had to drop a single column which was named 'Unnamed: 0' from both the arsenic and HAA5 datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Additionally, we needed to convert all of the numbers in these new datasets to floats as they were originally strings. \n",
    "  \n",
    "10. We merged the datasets by county\n",
    "11. We removed all columns not relevant to our data analysis. "
